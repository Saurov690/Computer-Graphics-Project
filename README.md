# Computer-Graphics-Project
It's a computer graphics project. In this, we were used GLUT Project function and OpenGL library function in Code Blocks and it's a group work project.
The "Spaceship System" project, created using OpenGL-GLUT, aims to create an immersive 3D experience by combining technical expertise with imaginative design. The project showcases the complexities of 3D modelling, animation, and interactive elements, demonstrating the capability of real-time rendering. The project focuses on human curiosity with space travel and the potential of futuristic planets, aiming to create narrative-driven graphics experiences that transcend still images.
